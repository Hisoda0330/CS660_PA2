1. Describe any design decisions you made.
For the B+ Tree, I make ensure the bufferpool write back the newly created page are written back and managed correctly
in memory. I use of vector to allow straightforward iteration and munipulation of tuples. The insertion of tuple is 
responsible to insert a new tuple into the B+ Tree, so first find the appropriate LeafPage for inserting the tuple
by traversing IndexPage nodes. If overflow, create new LeafPage. getTuple method is to get the iterator information
and deserialize the tuple to get the appropriate LeafPage. 
The insert method in IndexPage class is to insert new key and pointer into an internal index node. I approach with
placing the key in the correct sorted position and adjusts the associated child pointers. When it overflows after
insertion, it splits to maintain balance, creating a new IndexPage and redistribute the keys. The split method divide
the keys and pointers, with half remianing in the original IndexPage and moving to new_page to ensure the tree's
balance and don't exceed their capacity. After the split, the middle key is moved up to the parent node to adjust
the tree structure. 
The insertTuple in LeafPage class handles the insertion of a tuple into LeafPage, it maintains the sorted order for
efficient search and range queries. first inserts the tuple in vec_tuples, and sorts the collection to maintain order.
If the page is full after insertion, the method returns true to indicate split is needed. The split method calculates
the midpoint of the tuples, it moves the latter half to new_page. And the original LeafPage retians the first half
of the tuple. This method is to ensure B+ tree stays balanced and have efficient range queries and sequential
access. The getTuple method is to get a tuple from given slot within a LeafPage, I use the slot number to access
the correct offset within the page's data array and deserilized the tuple based on the TupleDesc. 



2. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.
I feel like the BTreeFile::insertTuple(): is lacked of detail logics. I'm not sure if there will be any errors
for larger trees. The recursive splits might propagate up the tree if an indexPage also becomes full after a new
insertion. Also the use of vector might affect the performance when dealing with larger datasets due to overhead of
sorting and mangaing memory. I think the getpage() to interact with the buffer pool but I think I could implemneted
it more for it to properly state wheather its pinned or unpinned to ensure no issue with memory management after pages
are evicted. I might need more checks for edge cases like inserting a duplicate key or handling an empty tree. 


3. Answer the analytical questions.
Q1.A common strategy employed in production systems is to maintain the internal nodes of indexes to always exist in the 
bufferpool (or rather, pin them to memory). Discuss why this is a good idea and if there are any implications of this 
strategy.

This is a good idea because it allows faster access to internal nodes during searches, inserts, and updates. It also reduces 
the number of disk I/O operations required to access these nodes, speeding up queries. The implications of the strategy consume 
memory resources from the buffer pool. So it would have less memory available for other data pages, if it takes up a lot of space, 
it would reduce the overall effectiveness of the buffer pool for other operations.


Q2.Maintaining an index of a file can slow down insertions and deletions as the index needs to be updated. However, it can speed up lookups. 
What are some strategies to minimize the impact of index maintenance on bulk insertions and deletions? What do you need to change in the implementation to 
support these strategies?

Instead of updating each insertion or deletion, we can batch multiple updates and apply them in a single operation, so it reduce index modifications. We can also modify 
the index update logic to accept batches of operations, allowing more efficient updates. Also, use a bulk-loading method for more effective insertions, by using bulk-load, 
it minimize the number of splits and reorganizations that was needed.


Q3.A common workload for database tables is to insert new entries with an auto-incrementing key. How can you optimize the BTreeFile for this workload?

We can use a memory buffer that holds new entries before flushing. them into B+Tree. When the buffer reaches a threshold, sort the entries and insert them in bulk into the 
B+ tree, by doing this it minimize the number of interactions with the disk. Also, ensure the buffer is flushed before a query that requires accessing to maintain 
consistency. 


4. Describe how long you spent on the assignment, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.
I Approximately spent about three days and total of 20 hours on the assignment. I found that the integration
of the bufferpool take most of the time. And the logic was challenging for me. Understanding and implementing
the interactions between B+ tree and the Bufferpool required a good understanding of how pages should be
pinned, unpinned, and managed in memory. Also making sure the balance after splitting and moving the correct
to the parent node after the leafpage is being splited. Also with the iterator logic, making it clear 
when it reach the end of one LeafPage and moving to the next needs careful thoughts to make sure the iterator
is in the correct node.
